<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Call Chart Screenshot][chart-screenshot]](https://github.com/EthanBonsignori/call-chart-react)

I wanted a simple way to see how many times I'd called unemployment without getting an answer, so I created this chart to keep track of each call. Pressing ether add call button adds a new datapoint to the graph at the time it was pressed.
