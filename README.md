## About The Project

[![Chart Screenshot][chart-screenshot]](https://github.com/EthanBonsignori/daily-chart)

This Chart app started as a way to track my phone calls to a certain government organization during a certain pandemic. I wanted it to be universal and customizable for other purposes, so I converted it to React, added settings, and a pretty UI so that anyone could use it. Why? To track occurences of just about anything over a day and see that data in a nice graph! And don't forget you can look at that data in bar-form over the past 7 or 30 days too, with optional weekend dates!
